excerpt: ''The paper is about improving GNSS positioning accuracy in urban environments, where NLOS (Non-Line-of-Sight) and multipath effects cause significant challenges. By employing an end-to-end deep learning approach, specifically a Transformer-based correction network, we significantly enhance GNSS positioning accuracy in these challenging scenarios.'
