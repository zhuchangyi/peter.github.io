Work experience
======
**GNSS Algorithm Engineer Intern**       Feb 2024 -- Present  
*GNSS Positioning Error Correction (Deep Learning Based End To End Design)*  
Enhanced traditional GNSS positioning algorithms using neural networks to address the accuracy degradation caused by multipath effects in urban environments.  

	**Publication**: [Enhancing GNSS Positioning Using Transformer-Based Correction Network (ION GNSS+ 2024)](https://www.ion.org/gnss/abstracts.cfm?paperID=13586)
  * Achieved a 25.9% reduction in horizontal MSE and a 42.3% reduction in vertical MSE on a real-world test set compared to the WLS algorithm in single-point positioning accuracy.
  * Improved neural network fitting capability by dividing the positioning results into error intervals, converting the regression problem into a combination of classification and regression.
  * Combined classification problems, considering pseudorange and environmental factors as inputs. Used data processing to extend constellations and address issues such as inconsistent data sizes per epoch and permutation invariance.

**Gemini2tg**       Feb 2024 -- Present: Personal Project  
  * Developed a one-click script to deploy LLM on Telegram chatbot, supporting text context and image understanding.
  * Achieved seamless data transmission between the Telegram API and the Google Gemini API.
  * Deployed the project using Docker containerization and Azure server for reliability and scalability.
  * Created a one-click Pipeline script for easy project configuration and deployment.
  * [**Gemini2tg**  Repository](https://github.com/zhuchangyi/Gemini2tg)


**InteractiveCodeNote**      Jun 2024 -- Present: Personal Project  
  * Inserted interactive code blocks anywhere, enabling users to submit Go language code via a frontend interface.
  * Developed a system to run code inside Docker containers, manage code versions, and deploy the backend on Azure and Oracle cloud servers.
  * Managed a container pool for efficient resource utilization.
  * Frontend interface deployed on GitHub Pages for easy access.
